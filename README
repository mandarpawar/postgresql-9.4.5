PostgreSQL Database Management System
=====================================

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------
For the initial configuration before make, using the following saves a lot of sweat later on, to go and edit a lot of things in the postgresql.conf file.

./configure --prefix=/home/bhavesh/pgsql --with-pgport=9432 --with-system-tzdata=/usr/share/zoneinfo --enable-debug --enable-cassert --enable-depend

Here, /home/bhavesh/pgsql is my postgres installation directory.

It is also useful to export the variable PGDATA

EXPORT PGDATA=/home/bhavesh/pgsql/data
